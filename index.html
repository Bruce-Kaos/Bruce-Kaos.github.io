      Welcome to the Hexic Lifesteal SMP website! The Hexic server is a minecraft server where, as the name sugests, you steal other player's hearts when you kill them. This server is split into
      seasons, after each season the world is restarted, and new players are invited. However new players can join at any time, but be aware, others will likely be ahead of you and see your
      hearts as easy pickings. See more about the server under the <a href="Hexicinfo.html">info</a> tab.
